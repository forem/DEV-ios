# DEV iOS ðŸ’–

This is the repo for the [dev.to](/) iOS app. It is still a work in progress, but getting there!

# Design ethose

We will grow to include more native code over time, but for now we are taking the approach of _native shell/web views_. This approach lost favor early in iOS days, but I believe it is a very valid approach these days. It is inspired by how Basecamp does things. Our tech stack is a bit different, but the ideas are the same.

By leveraging `wkwebviews` as much as possible, I think we can make this all pretty awesome and sync up with our web dev work pretty smoothly. And where it makes sense, we can re-implement certain things fully native, or build entirely native features. Life's a journey, not a destination.
